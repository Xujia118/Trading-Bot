Major Flaw as of Oct. 2024 
The logic is too aggressive at buying low. But when the market is bearish, there are many false signals
that prompt the algorithm to buy.
We can complement technical analysis with ML.

Group by tasks:
establish stocks bases
run technical analysis (including test)
decide trading actions
place order
report

Integrate ML: to be included in technical analysis
1. can we buy this stock?
2. how much money can we make?
3. is there a better way to use money?

Start refactoring technical analysis. Add ML.
Then OOP the rest

Fixed Dockerfile, now adding old versions of yfinance and pandas. 
But in the future, updating to new versions and therefore updating df reading logic is inevitable.
